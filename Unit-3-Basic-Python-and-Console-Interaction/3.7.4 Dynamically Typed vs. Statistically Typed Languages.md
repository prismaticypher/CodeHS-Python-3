Dynamic Typing:
In dynamically typed languages, variable types are determined at runtime. This means you don't have to declare the data type of a variable explicitly; it is inferred during execution.

Advantages:
- Flexibility: You can assign different types of values to a variable during the execution of the program, providing flexibility in coding.
- Productivity: Dynamic typing often leads to shorter, more readable code as you don't need to explicitly mention types.

Disadvantages:
- Runtime Errors: Since type checking happens during runtime, there's a possibility of encountering type-related errors only during execution.
- Performance: Dynamic typing can result in slower performance as the interpreter must determine the type of each variable during runtime.


Statically Typed:
In statically typed languages, variable types are explicitly declared and checked at compile-time. The data type of a variable is known before the program is executed.

Advantages:
- Early Error Detection: Type checking at compile-time helps catch errors before the program is executed, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.
- Performance: Statically typed languages can be more efficient in terms of execution speed because the types are known in advance.

Disadvantages:
- Verbose: Code can be more verbose due to the explicit declaration of types, potentially making it longer and harder to read.
- Less Flexibility: You need to declare the type of a variable beforehand, which can be limiting in certain scenarios where you want more dynamic behavior.
