Compiled Languages:
In compiled languages, the source code is translated into machine code or an intermediate code by a compiler before execution.
Execution Process:
Compilation: The entire source code is translated into machine code or an intermediate code.
Linking: If necessary, multiple compiled files are linked together to create the final executable.
Execution: The compiled code is executed by the computer's hardware.
Performance:
Optimization: Since the entire code is translated beforehand, compilers can apply extensive optimizations, potentially leading to better performance.
Faster Execution: Generally, compiled languages tend to have faster execution speeds.
Development Speed:
Slower Build Process: Compilation is an additional step in the development process, which can slow down the development cycle.
Debugging: Debugging may be more time-consuming because changes require recompilation.
Error Handling:
Early Detection: Many errors are caught during the compilation process, leading to early error detection.
Runtime Errors: Some errors may only be detected during runtime.


Interpreted Languages:
In interpreted languages, the source code is executed line by line by an interpreter.
Execution Process:
Parsing: The interpreter reads and parses the source code line by line.
Execution: Each line is executed immediately after being parsed.
Performance:
Runtime Overhead: Interpreted languages may have a runtime overhead as the code is interpreted during execution.
Less Optimization: Since there is no separate compilation step, optimizations are limited.
Development Speed.
Faster Iteration: Interpreted languages often allow for faster development cycles as there's no need for a compilation step.
Easier Debugging: Errors can be debugged on the fly without the need for recompilation.
Error Handling:
On-the-Fly Detection: Errors are often detected on-the-fly during execution.
Late Discovery: Some errors may only be discovered during runtime.
